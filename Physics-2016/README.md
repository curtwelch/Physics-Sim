Physics-2016
------------

This directory contains saved copies of the old files from my work in 2016 on this project.

It can be ignored unless you want to understand what I was doing at the beginning of this project.

The **notes** file is a running diary I like to keep while working on a project like this to show my thinking, my learning, and my progress.
